    <h4>About</h4>
    <h1>handmade & puppy loved</h1>
    <div>Making things fills my heart up with joy, and my wish is to share that feeling by having people enjoy what I've made. I want you to let all of the stress and depression melt away when you feel/see my art. I want you to know that I'm here for you and you are NOT ALONE in facing your battles. I am giving you a hug everytime you notice my creation.</div>
